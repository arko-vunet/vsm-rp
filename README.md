# vuSmartMaps Rapid Prototyping

This is a Rapid prototyping app built with Vite + React. This project is meant to allow designers at VuNet Systems to quickly iterate on clickable UI-prorotypes to get feedback and alignment. At this point in time, we're not expecting to contribute to the production codebase, yet.
